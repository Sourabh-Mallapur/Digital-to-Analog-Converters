## Introduction

Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs) are fundamental components in electronic systems, responsible for converting digital signals into analog signals. This repository showcases full-custom designs implemented using Cadence Virtuoso.

## Designs
All the design starts with a basic block - Two Stage OPAMP



- **[DAC Model 1](./designs/DAC_model_1):** Description of the first DAC model, including design specifications and considerations.

- **[DAC Model 2](./designs/DAC_model_2):** Details about the second DAC model, its architecture, and design choices.

Feel free to explore each design directory for more information.

## Simulation

Simulation plays a crucial role in validating the functionality and performance of the DAC designs. In this repository, you can find simulation results and analysis for each DAC model.

- **[Simulation of DAC Model 1](./simulation/DAC_model_1):** Results and insights obtained from simulating the first DAC model.

- **[Simulation of DAC Model 2](./simulation/DAC_model_2):** Simulation data and observations for the second DAC model.
